          Hi, I'm Desiree! I'm a licensed independent nail technician based in
          San Diego that specializes in structured gel manicures and hand
          painted nail art using high quality Japanese gel. My priority is to
          provide long lasting manicures on natural nails so they can grow out
          healthy and strong!
